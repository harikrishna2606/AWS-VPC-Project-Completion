# AWS-VPC-Project-Completion
Creating Custom VPC infrastructure

Project Overview

This project involved designing, implementing, and deploying a fully functional AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment. The objective was to create a scalable and secure network infrastructure that can host web applications, databases, and other services.

Key Features

Custom VPC Creation: Set up a custom VPC with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
Subnet Configuration: Configured public and private subnets for segregating different types of resources and ensuring security and accessibility.
Internet Gateway: Deployed an Internet Gateway to allow communication between the public subnet and the internet.
NAT Gateway: Implemented a NAT Gateway to enable instances in the private subnet to access the internet without exposing them to external traffic.
Route Tables: Created and associated route tables to control the traffic flow within the VPC and between subnets.
Security Groups: Defined security groups to regulate inbound and outbound traffic for instances, ensuring robust security measures.
